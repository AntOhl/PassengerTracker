    "Story telling: Given circumstances (weather, delays, snowball effects...) and stakes held by flight travels (pressure on time, holidays, stress, family visits, children, elderly, disabled...), airline companies face fierce retaliations from customers online. Some events often go viral and threaten a whole company's reputation in a blink (for example, passenger expelled from a Delta airplane). That makes a case of strategic importance for airline companies to take the pulse of customer satisfaction in real time in order to take adequate operational actions proactively, rather than reactively."
