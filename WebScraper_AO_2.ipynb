Our flight back on the A380 was significantly less enjoyable. Boarding was reasonably efficient, but I was again the victim of additional security checks at the gate (Happened my last trip in Taiwan as well) which meant I didn't get to board with my friend, and was among the last people on the aircraft. Luckily I didn't have any issues finding overhead space once finally onboard. Once on the plane I was shocked at how dated and worn everything appeared. Seat covers were ill fitting and faded, cabin lighting was dull, the IFE system was among the oldest and in quite poor condition, the remote was filthy, and the bathroom was something Air France should be ashamed of. I can only imagine that since they're already looking to retire half their fleet of 10 A380's they're avoiding putting absolutely any money into them. I've included photos of the more glaring discrepancies. The first meal service occured in the strangest and most haphazard manner I've ever experienced. Seated in row 46 there were about 5 rows behind and two rows ahead in our section. They began serving the rows at the back first, but then stopped, skipped the front three including my own row, then moved on to the next section of seating. After starting at the front t of that section they worked their way backwards until our row was the very last served. This meant room temperature food, and a wait of over an hour all while enjoying the aroma of food in the cabin directly behind us. In addition, the cabin crew disappeared completely for about 6 hours in the middle of the flight. At some point some snacks were placed in the galley area but we were never notified or served. I just happened to see someone seated ahead of me return with ice cream and was lucky to be in an aisle seat where I could grab one myself.
